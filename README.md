## 📊 Project Steps

### 1️⃣ Database and Table Setup  
- Created the SUPERSHOP database.  
- Ensured data integrity by backing up the original dataset.  

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing  
- Added new date columns and converted textual date values into proper DATE format.  
- Removed old date columns to maintain data consistency.  
- Renamed new columns for clarity.  

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
EDA was conducted to understand the dataset's structure and identify key business insights:  
- Checked table structure and data distribution.  
- Counted missing values to assess data quality.  
- Analyzed numerical fields (min, max, average) to understand sales trends.  
- Identified top-performing products, regions, and shipping modes.  
- Evaluated the impact of discounts on profitability.  
- Determined the return rate of products and its effect on revenue.  

### 4️⃣ Sales & Profit Analysis  
- Analyzed total sales and profitability trends over time (monthly and yearly).  
- Compared sales and profit by shipping mode, region, and customer segment.  
- Identified best-selling and least profitable products.  

### 5️⃣ Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)  
- Implemented **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis** to classify customers into different segments:  
  - **Best Customers**  
  - **Loyal Customers**  
  - **Big Spenders**  
  - **Potential Loyalists**  
  - **At-Risk Customers**  
  - **Lost Customers**
